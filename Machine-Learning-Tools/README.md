# Guides, materials and data scientist notes for different tools
This repository is my online storage for scripts and guides that I use for my machine learning data science projects.

## Getting Started
* Sometimes the github has some issue (backend?) and ipynb are not readable, in that case please use [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
* If you want to print the md files in pdf for offline reading please use [gitprint](https://gitprint.com/)

## Content
Currently there are 2 categories :
* Summary of machine learning tools and how to use them effectively
* Gathered resources for Deep Learning
